# Blog source code

This is the source code for my blog: https://jocki.me

### Add New Post

1. Create a new feature branch.
1. Add the new post as `mdx` file in `src/content/docs/blog` folder in the format like `YYYY-MM-DD-title.mdx`.
1. Preview the new post by running `npm run dev`.
1. Commit and push to GitHub, then create a new Pull Request (PR).  A new live preview URL will be added in the PR.  Open this URL to see how the website will look like when it is deployed to live.
1. If everything is fine, merge the PR to main branch.  The new post will appear in live website (https://jocki.me).
